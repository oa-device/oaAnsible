# OrangeAd Device Setup Playbook - Implementation Plan

## TODO List

### 1. Project Setup

- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository for the project
- [ ] Set up the basic directory structure as outlined in the README.md
- [ ] Create an initial `ansible.cfg` file with basic configurations
- [ ] Set up a `requirements.yml` file for any external Ansible roles

### 2. Inventory Management

- [ ] Set up separate host groups for MacOS and Ubuntu devices
- [ ] Document the process for adding new devices to the inventory

### 3. Role Development

#### 3.1 Common Role

- [ ] Create a `common` role for tasks applicable to both MacOS and Ubuntu
- [ ] Implement tasks for basic system configuration (e.g., timezone, locale)
- [ ] Set up tasks for installing common tools and utilities

#### 3.2 MacOS Role

- [ ] Create a `macos` role for MacOS-specific tasks
- [ ] Implement tasks for installing Homebrew
- [ ] Set up tasks for installing MacOS applications via Homebrew Cask
- [ ] Implement tasks for configuring MacOS system preferences

#### 3.3 Ubuntu Role

- [ ] Create an `ubuntu` role for Ubuntu-specific tasks
- [ ] Implement tasks for updating apt cache and upgrading packages
- [ ] Set up tasks for installing Ubuntu applications
- [ ] Implement tasks for configuring Ubuntu system preferences

### 4. Playbook Development

- [ ] Create a main playbook (`main.yml`) that includes OS-specific playbooks
- [ ] Develop a MacOS-specific playbook (`playbooks/macos.yml`)
- [ ] Develop an Ubuntu-specific playbook (`playbooks/ubuntu.yml`)
- [ ] Ensure playbooks use the appropriate roles and tasks

### 5. Configuration Management

- [ ] Create an `example.config.yml` file with default values
- [ ] Implement logic to use a custom `config.yml` file for overrides
- [ ] Document all available configuration options

### 6. Testing

- [ ] Set up a testing environment with both MacOS and Ubuntu VMs
- [ ] Develop and document a testing protocol
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (e.g., GitHub Actions)

### 7. Documentation

- [ ] Complete the README.md with detailed usage instructions
- [ ] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
- [ ] Document the purpose and usage of each role
- [ ] Create a changelog to track version changes

### 8. Security Considerations

- [ ] Implement Ansible Vault for securing sensitive data
- [ ] Document best practices for key management
- [ ] Ensure all tasks follow the principle of least privilege

### 9. Optimization

- [ ] Review and optimize task execution order
- [ ] Implement handlers for better efficiency
- [ ] Use async tasks where appropriate for long-running operations

### 10. Additional Features

- [ ] Implement a mechanism for easy rollbacks
- [ ] Create tasks for setting up development environments (IDEs, SDKs, etc.)
- [ ] Develop a post-installation checklist or verification playbook

### 11. User Acceptance Testing

- [ ] Conduct UAT with team members on real devices
- [ ] Gather feedback and implement necessary changes
- [ ] Document any known issues or limitations

### 12. Deployment

- [ ] Create a release strategy (versioning, tagging)
- [ ] Develop a distribution method for the playbook
- [ ] Create user guides for running the playbook on new devices

### 13. Maintenance Plan

- [ ] Set up a schedule for regular reviews and updates
- [ ] Implement a process for handling user-reported issues
- [ ] Plan for keeping the playbook updated with new OS versions

### 14. Training

- [ ] Develop training materials for team members
- [ ] Conduct a workshop on using and contributing to the playbook
- [ ] Create a FAQ document based on common questions and issues

By completing these tasks, we will have a comprehensive Ansible playbook for setting up both MacOS and Ubuntu devices for the OrangeAd project, with a focus on fresh installs and consistent configurations across all devices.
