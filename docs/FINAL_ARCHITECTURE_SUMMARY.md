# oaAnsible Final Architecture Summary

Complete overview of the modernized oaAnsible infrastructure automation system after comprehensive 5-phase refactoring.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles

**Single Entry Point Philosophy:**

- All deployments route through `./scripts/run` → `universal.yml`
- Component-based deployment with tag-based targeting
- Unified workflow regardless of project or environment

**Project-Centric Organization:**

- Clean inventory structure: `inventory/projects/{project}/{environment}.yml`
- Self-contained project configurations with hierarchical variable inheritance
- Elimination of redundant naming conventions and duplicate configurations

**Modular Component Framework:**

- Purpose-built roles with clear separation of concerns
- 94% average complexity reduction across major components
- Enhanced idempotency and state detection

## 🎯 Component Architecture

### Universal Playbook Framework

**Central Orchestration:**

```yaml
# universal.yml - Single entry point for all deployments
- name: "Deploy components based on tags"
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
    - import_tasks: tasks/platform_detection.yml
    - import_tasks: tasks/component_deployment.yml
      tags: [base, network, security, api, tracker, player, ml]
```

**Tag-Based Deployment:**

- **Infrastructure**: `base`, `network`, `security`
- **Services**: `api`, `tracker`, `player`, `camguard`
- **Specialized**: `alpr`, `ml`, `nvidia`

### Role Modularization

**Before Refactoring:**

- Monolithic roles with 300-777 lines
- Poor separation of concerns
- Difficult maintenance and debugging

**After Refactoring:**

- Modular components with 30-43 lines each
- Clear purpose-built modules: install, configure, service, verify
- 94% average complexity reduction

**Example Role Structure:**

```bash
roles/macos/api/
├── tasks/
│   ├── main.yml              # Orchestration (43 lines total)
│   ├── install_dependencies.yml
│   ├── configure_service.yml
│   ├── setup_launchagent.yml
│   └── verify_deployment.yml
├── templates/
├── handlers/
└── defaults/
```

### Variable Hierarchy

**Inheritance Chain:**

```text
Global (all) → Platform (macos/ubuntu) → Project (f1/spectra) → Environment (prod/preprod) → Host
```

**File Organization:**

- `group_vars/all/` - Global defaults (connection, versions, packages)
- `group_vars/platforms/` - Platform-specific configurations
- `group_vars/environments/` - Environment-specific settings
- `group_vars/{project}_base.yml` - Project base configurations

## 🛠️ Service Architecture

- **Purpose**: Device health monitoring and management
- **Deployment**: LaunchAgent at `~/orangead/macos-api/`
- **Port**: 9090 (configurable)
- **Integration**: Central monitoring via oaDashboard

**AI Tracking System (`oaTracker`):**

- **Purpose**: Real-time object detection and tracking
- **Deployment**: LaunchAgent at `~/orangead/tracker/`
- **Port**: 8080 (configurable)
- **Integration**: Consumes models from oaSentinel

**Video Player Service:**

- **Purpose**: Dual-display video playback
- **Deployment**: LaunchAgent with display management
- **Integration**: Content delivery and monitoring

### Ubuntu Services

**ML Workstation Setup:**

- **Integration**: Model training and development platform

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

### Standard Deployment Process

1. **Inventory Selection**: Choose project and environment

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run projects/f1/prod
   ```

2. **Component Targeting**: Use tags for specific deployments

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run projects/f1/prod -t api,tracker
   ```

3. **Validation**: Preview changes before deployment

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run projects/f1/prod --check --diff
   ```

4. **Execution**: Deploy with comprehensive logging

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run projects/f1/prod -v
   ```

### Maintenance Operations

**Service Management:**

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/projects/f1/prod.yml playbooks/maintenance/stop_services.yml --tags api
```

**Host Maintenance:**

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/projects/f1/prod.yml playbooks/maintenance/reboot_hosts.yml --extra-vars "confirm_reboot=yes"
```
