# OrangeAd Device Setup Playbook - Implementation Plan

## TODO List

### 1. Project Setup

- [x] Set up the basic directory structure as outlined in the README.md
- [x] Create an initial `ansible.cfg` file with basic configurations
- [x] Set up a `requirements.yml` file for any external Ansible roles
- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository for the project (if not already done)

### 2. Inventory Management

- [x] Create an initial inventory file for macOS devices
- [ ] Set up separate host groups for different environments (e.g., staging, production)
- [ ] Document the process for adding new devices to the inventory

### 3. Role Development

#### 3.1 MacOS Role

- [x] Implement tasks for installing Homebrew
- [x] Set up tasks for installing MacOS applications via Homebrew Cask
- [x] Implement tasks for configuring MacOS system preferences

- [x] Ensure playbook uses the appropriate roles and tasks
- [ ] Optimize playbook structure and task organization

### 5. Configuration Management

- [x] Create a `default.config.yml` file with default values
- [x] Implement logic to use a custom `config.yml` file for overrides
- [ ] Document all available configuration options in detail

### 6. Testing

- [ ] Set up a testing environment with macOS VMs
- [ ] Develop and document a comprehensive testing protocol
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (e.g., GitHub Actions)

### 7. Documentation

- [x] Update the README.md with detailed usage instructions
- [ ] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
- [ ] Document the purpose and usage of each role and major task
- [ ] Create a changelog to track version changes

### 8. Security Considerations

- [ ] Document best practices for key management
- [ ] Review and ensure all tasks follow the principle of least privilege

### 9. Optimization

- [ ] Review and optimize task execution order
- [ ] Implement handlers for better efficiency
- [ ] Use async tasks where appropriate for long-running operations

### 10. Additional Features

- [ ] Implement a mechanism for easy rollbacks
- [ ] Create tasks for setting up additional development environments (IDEs, SDKs, etc.)
- [ ] Develop a post-installation checklist or verification playbook

### 11. User Acceptance Testing

- [ ] Conduct UAT with team members on real devices
- [ ] Gather feedback and implement necessary changes
- [ ] Document any known issues or limitations

### 12. Deployment

- [ ] Create a release strategy (versioning, tagging)
- [ ] Develop a distribution method for the playbook
- [ ] Create user guides for running the playbook on new devices

### 13. Maintenance Plan

- [ ] Set up a schedule for regular reviews and updates
- [ ] Implement a process for handling user-reported issues
- [ ] Plan for keeping the playbook updated with new macOS versions

### 14. Training

- [ ] Develop training materials for team members
- [ ] Conduct a workshop on using and contributing to the playbook
- [ ] Create a FAQ document based on common questions and issues

By completing these tasks, we will have a comprehensive Ansible playbook for setting up macOS devices for the OrangeAd project, with a focus on fresh installs and consistent configurations across all devices.
